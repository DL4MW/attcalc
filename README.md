Program for calculation the attenuation of coax cables

The program calcuates the attenuation of a coax cable with a given length at a given frequency.

There is a cable library included, but own cables can easy be added if the frequency - attenuation table from a datasheet is available.
From such a table a typical attenuation equation for the cable is calculated so the attenuation can be calcul
ated at any frequency.
